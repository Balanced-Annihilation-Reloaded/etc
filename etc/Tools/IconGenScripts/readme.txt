Copy ./luarules to game dir
Copy ./buildicons to spring dir

Icon generator creates two folders in /SpringDir/buildicons

After creating icons in spring run either overlayPNG.bat or overlayDDS.bat (BAR widgets are set to use DDS)

Copy newly created "Overlays" and "Units" to /gameDir/luaui/images/buildIcons/

Done
