these screenshots were created with the example widget in this dir 
they show which of the startpoints in the table in luarules/configs/ffastartpoints/* correspond to which locations

to remake, start a game with 16 nullai on the appropriate map, with the widget active
the widget will write a table of startpoints (to your spring datadir) and display the corresponding numbers for you to screenshot
there is no guarantee that doing this will produce the same order each time; it's unsynced
